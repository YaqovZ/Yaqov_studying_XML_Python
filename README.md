# Studying XML
Hi! This is Yaqov. I am studying XML and I post what I wrote and did. On 13 Jan I learned XML is similar to HTML and can be parsed by BeautifulSoup. Alternatively, one can write an SAX parser specific to the file. The advantages include that a specialized parser can be more efficient because it only looks for the elements and attributes it cares about and it is easier to maintain. Finally the parsed content can be dumped into a json file for further data processing.
Or using BeautifulSoup one can turn it into a pandas dataframe. The current python notebook did all these processed the XML dataset a little bit.

The project will include elements that are more advanced and handle errors as well as validity (abiding by schemas).
